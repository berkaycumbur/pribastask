Basic project for CRUD examples. Firstly I created models for project. Created models for timeline and moments. Defined collection values. After created repo files for interact with dbs. In the controller files created endpoints for create, delete, update, search for tags and read. In service folder created a sequence for ID incrementing. In the end connected database with our application "application.properties" file.
